# Question 10
---

## Initiation
```{r}
library(ISLR)
data(Carseats)
```

## (a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price, Urban, and US.
```{r}
fit <- lm(Carseats$Sales ~ Carseats$Price+Carseats$Urban+Carseats$US)
summary(fit)
```

## (b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Becareful some of the variables in the model are qualitative!

When price increases by 1 and other variable stay unchanged, the sales will decrease by 0.054.
When Urban increases by 1 and other variable stay unchanged, the sales will decrease by 0.021.
The US sales on average 1.2 more than non-US.

## (c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.


$Sales = 13.043469 + Price \times(-0.054459)+ Urban \times (-0.021916) + US \times 1.200573$

## (d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H0 : βj = 0?

***I don't know what is null hypothesis H0 : βj = 0***

## (e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.
```{r}
fit1 <- lm(Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
summary(fit1)
```

## (f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data ?

We can measure the performance of models by `Multiple R-squared` values.
Both values are around 0.23 which indicates models are not good since they are much smaller than 1

## (g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).
```{r}
confint(fit1)
```

## (h) Is there evidence of outliers or high leverage observations in the model from (e) ?
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit1)
```
